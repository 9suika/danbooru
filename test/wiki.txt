Romaji source: http://doujinshi.mugimugi.org/author/4828/

Stage 4 theme music of [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]] is named ヴワル魔法図書館 (Voile, the Magic Library). Based on this, a few fans (mostly English-speaking fandom) had considered Voile the name of the [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]]'s library.

However, this is not canon and ZUN has consistently refered to this library as "Scarlet Devil Mansion's Library" or "The Magic Library" in official works without any mention of "Voile". See also topic #9233.

The library is tended to by [[Patchouli Knowledge]], [[fairy_maid|fairy maids]] and possibly [[Koakuma]]. [[Kirisame Marisa]] frequently breaks in to "borrow" (read: steal) books, but occasionally will sit peacefully with Patchouli.

The library is often depicted as a massive tesseract (larger on the inside) or even a pocket dimension attached to the mansion.

h4. User Record Guidelines

User Records are used on Danbooru as a means of commenting Users. Records are to be used sparingly, and generally only to bring to attention behavior which either significantly disrupts or improves Danbooru's capacity to serve its purpose.

Records can be either positive or negative. Any user with a Privileged or higher Level may issue User Records.

h6. Politeness, Please

Please be polite when issuing user records, especially Negative records. Records are the complete opposite of the [[about:mod_queue|Mod Queue]]; the Queue is totally subjective while the [b]Records must be as objective as possible.[/b] Keep rage on User Records to a minimum, if it is not possible to eliminate it completely, the same way as you have done in the forums.

h6. Negative Records

Issue negative records to bring attention to a particular user's behavior which undoubtedly compromises Danbooru's operations. 

Before issuing a negative record, [b]give ample warning.[/b] All disruptive behavior by any user must be made known to them in a warning Private Message. Always contact individual users to warn them before issuing a negative record, as seemingly malicious behavior is often the consequence of pure ignorance. [b]Refer the users to the appropriate guides[/b], which are readily accessible from the [[help:home|Wiki Help]].


Consequences which accompany Negative Records include Blocks, Bans and Demotions (having an account downgraded to a lower level).

Issues between Users are to be resolved by communication through Dmail (private messages). Negative records are not a form of revenge and are not to be given frivolously.


h6. Positive Records

Issue Positive Records when a [b]user has done service to Danbooru[/b] in helping it serve its purpose as an easily searchable archive of high-quality anime art.

Users with sufficient Positive Records may [b]earn Builder accounts[/b] or special permissions for their contributions to Danbooru. The added features from getting promoted is both a request to continue keeping up their service and a reward for their service.

It is important to note that [b]positive records are not exemptions[/b] from the Terms of Service and Danbooru Quality Guidelines. Users with poor and good User Records alike are obliged to follow the same rules to the same extent.

h4. Reasons for Positive and Negative Records

This is a list of the most common reasons to issue Negative and Positive records. For a detailed history of records on Danbooru, refer to the "Records Page":/user_record.

h6. Justifications for Negative Records

* Posts
** Circumventing post moderation.
** Low-Quality Uploads.
*** Abuse of the 'unrestricted uploads' permission to consistently upload sub-par images.
** Pestering Mod Queue Masters to approve your posts.
** Persistently uploading own art.

* Notes and Translations
** Using notes for personal comments, as seen on Yahoo! Flickr or Photobucket.
*** Notes are for Translations and Comments Relevant to the illustration only (such as character identification in [[absolutely_everyone]] murals).

** Persistently downright inaccurate translations.
*** Minor misinterpretations are tolerated and will be fixed by a fluent translator, but providing inaccurate translations and tagging a post as translated makes it difficult to track down bad translations.

* Tags
** Refusing to properly tag uploads in accordance to Danbooru Quality Guidelines.

* Comments and Forums
** Requesting images or other material on forums.
** Soliciting goods and services on forums.
** Using the Forums for off-topic discussions unrelated to Danbooru.

** Posting of juvenile one-liners.
*** Obscure one-liner in-jokes which other Danbooru users do not understand.
*** Opinions on characters depicted on illustrations (Example: FUCK YOU SASUKE).
*** Overuse of emoticons in comments forum posts (Example: =O.O= OMG!!! Edward is so HOT!).

** Rage
*** Personal attacks directed at Danbooru users.
*** Threatening language.

* Pools
** Creation of Favorite pools.
*** Please use your Account's built-in Favorite Posts feature for this.
** Creation of Pointless pools.
*** Pointless Pools are pools which attempt to duplicate the functionality of tags. An example would be an "[[Izayoi Sakuya]] in lingerie pool", the same result may be achieved with a search like {{izayoi_sakuya lingerie}}.

* Spoilers
** Writing prominently readable spoilers into Wiki pages, the Forum and image comments.

* Wiki
** Creation of Pointless Wiki pages.
*** Pointless Wiki pages include
*** Vanity pages, or pages about Danbooru users. Danbooru's Wiki is strictly for documentation only.
** Persistently using Wiki pages for personal opinions.

* User Records
** Issuing Negative records without justification, or without ample warning.
** Issuing Positive records to make friends.
*** Remember that user records are for reporting persistent behaviors only.

* Vandalism and Trolling
** Doing all of the above in order to elicit fury from Danbooru users.


h6. Justifications for Positive Records

* Posts
** Consistently uploading high-quality anime-style illustrations.
** Consistently uploading good-quality doujins that other Danbooru users like.
*** Uploading doujins untranslated, and then laying translated text using notes.
** Consistent high-quality uploads by basic Members may be rewarded with the 'unrestricted uploads' permission.

* Tags
** Completing tagging jobs left behind by uploaders (Tag Gardening).
** Consistent comprehensive tagging.
** Proper use of the forums to resolve tagging issues.

* Comments and Forums
** Bringing to light important issues related to Translations, Tagging, Uploads, and other technical issues that no other user on Danbooru has ever formally considered.

* Pools
** Organizing related posts and doujin pages into pools.
*** Properly ordering Doujin pages for easy reading.
** Ensuring that pools are used only for their intended purpose

* Notes
** Providing high-quality translations.
*** High quality translations are accurate, and convey their original emotions from the native language as intact as possible.
** Providing a high-quality solution to a particularly challenging translation which all other Danbooru users have so far failed.

* Wiki
** Maintaining Danbooru's tag mini dictionary and encyclopedia.
*** Writing good Wiki pages or improving existing ones.
*** Bonus if your Wiki editing sparks new interest in the copyright or characters you were writing about.
** Improving Danbooru's documentation.
*** Resolving inaccuracies in Danbooru's help.
** [spoiler]Seeking and destroying spoilers.[/spoiler]

* User Records
** Appropriately giving positive records to consistently diligent contributors, and negative records to repeated disruptive behavior after ample warning.

A fictional transformable [[mecha]] from the [[Macross]] [[science fiction]] series. It first appeared in the [[Macross 2]] OVA from 1992.

The [b]VA-1SS Metal Siren[/b] is an advanced and very powerful combat-capable prototype variable fighter. It is armed with an experimental "EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) anti-capital ship device":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse, missiles, and many energy weapons.

エメラダ

Character from [[Xenogears]].

A young girl discovered in the ruins of an ancient city that is now below sea level.  She is, in fact, an artificial construct built of nanomachines 4000 years ago, and has the ability to morph her body in practically any way she sees fit.  An optional (but implied by the ending to be canonical) event later in the game will cause her to age in appearance to a more adult form.

In fact, [spoiler]she was created by Kim Kasim, the second known reincarnation of Abel, who was researching a genetic condition causing infertility in the Zeboim populace, by combining Elly's genetic pattern with a nanomachine colony; however, Kim never saw his work come to fruition, as he was killed - and the Zeboim civilization destroyed - before she could awaken.  Emeralda recognizes Fei as Kim, and it seems to take her a while to see them as different people.[/spoiler]

Her Gear is [[Crescens]].

Vocaloid China started as a contest involving the software [[Vocaloid]]. The purpose of the contest was to submit entries of an original Vocaloid character which would eventually become the official avatar of the first Chinese Vocaloid.
In January, 2014, the project name was completely replaced by "[b]Vocanese[/b]".

The top choice was Yayin Gongyu. The runners up were Chou, MOKO, Ling Caiyin and Yayin. However the entries were subject to changes as stated by the company, thus the characters were refined and renamed:

* [[Luo Tianyi]]
* [[Mo Qingxian]]
* [[Zhiyu Moke]]
* [[Yuezheng Ling]] 
* [[Yuezheng Longya]]

From the second project:
* [[Yan He]]

Kimura (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), chicken wing/double wristlock (wrestling), or reverse keylock are terms used to specify a medial keylock known in judo as gyaku ude-garami (reverse arm entanglement) or simply as ude-garami. The application is similar to the americana, except that it is reversed. It needs some space behind the opponent to be effective, and can be applied from the side control or guard. Contrary to the americana, the opponent's wrist is grabbed with the hand on the same side, and the opposite arm is put behind the opponent's arm, again grabbing the attacker's wrist and forming a figure-four. By controlling the opponent's body and cranking the arm away from the attacker, pressure is put on the shoulder joint, and depending on the angle, also the elbow joint (in some variations the opponent's arm is brought behind their back, resulting in a finishing position resembling that of the hammerlock outlined below). The kimura was named after the judoka Masahiko Kimura, who used it to defeat one of the founders of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hélio Gracie.

A TV series that is part of the [[My Little Pony]] franchise, mainly focusing on friendship and giving the ponies distinct personalities. It was designed to appeal to a broader audience by avoiding the usual trends of shows intended for children and girls, and occasionally has jokes that younger viewers would not understand. Because of this, the show has gained a large fanbase of teenagers and adults, and the crew of the show sometimes inserts jokes or references to these fans.

Refers to a stripe that contains, features, or is composed of of leaves.

This tag will most frequently refer to outfits or other clothing that resembles those of "Aya Shameimaru's":/posts?tags=shameimaru_aya outfits from her {{Mountain of Faith}} and {{Double Spoiler}} appearances. In both cases, her shirt and skirt bore a long vertical yellow/brown/orange stripe with maple leaves all up and down its length. 

Although this outfit is unique to these two games (Aya wears a simple {{dress shirt}} and black {{skirt}} in the majority of her other appearances), it is a feature much like her {{black wings}} from [i]Bohemian Archive In Japanese Red[/i]--"optional extras" of hers that have very few canon appearances, but which nevertheless frequently appear in fanart.

In Aya's case, the stripe need not actually [i]be[/i] a stripe (ex: post #1493486) nor actually [i]have[/i] leaves (ex: post #1494014) [b]as long as the artist's intention to replicate or imitate this particular outfit is clear.[/b] In determining this, it may help to note that the stripe runs down the left side of her shirt, and down the middle of her skirt (Not that they won't screw up even that, on occasion).

Cosplayer.

Potentially ambiguous tag.

One use is for a character who looks just like[[Azuma Hatsumi]] from the eroge and anime [[Yami to Boushi to Hon no Tabibito]].  Fujihime, however, has blue eyes while Hatsumi has red eyes.  She appears in the book world where the protagonists meet [[meirin|Meirin]].  She is not referred to with a surname (only what would appear to be a title), and thus is tagged only [[Fujihime]].



This tag denotes the presence of yellow tape with the words "Keep Out" written on it (sometimes with variations). Such ribbons are used by police to fence off crime scenes.
